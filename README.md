New Project Ideas: 

## 1) In-Store

A customer walks into a grocery store after a long, hard day at work. Needless to say, the person is already not in the mood to shop. After taking a quick glance at the shopping list, the person pushes the cart around briskly, grabs the necessities and tosses them into the cart. As the person jostles the way through the crowded aisles, he/she is unable to find one or two products from the shopping list. The store associate, however, is nowhere to be found. The person is no longer interested in pruchasing that products. Thus, the person picks up whatever they can find, proceeds to the billing counter and after an agonizingly long wait, makes the payment and leaves.

## 2) Pre-store

Customer does shopping from store and receipt gets generated. 
Customer will upload receipt for every shopping and after analyzing those shopping items, notifications and suggestions of stores and items will be given to the customer about to do shopping list.

Old Ideas:

1) Pricify

Finding your dream house is painstaking job nowadays and what makes it harder is knowing correct price for it! 
Or 
If you are selling your house getting right price is again a worrisome job.

We have decided to build an interactive chatbot application will ask a home buyer to describe their dream house and will extract features from text to predict house price. 

We will use advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting 
On approximately 79 feature set to design self-learning algorithm for price prediction.
Interactive chat feature will be accomplished by using Conversation API at bluemix.net

####Prof: I like this idea of collecting input from user and building various models to predict home value. I would suggest to build not just home value but 6 or more comparable sales in that area. Before a buyer goes bidding or buying on a house he needs to validate the authenticity of your projected price. Only way to do that is to build comparables.
Also make sure you build a recommended system in this case build home values in other US cities as well. talk to me more about it.. 

2) Human or Robot?

In today's digital world, softwares are used everywhere to expedite the completion of the task.  Thus, the robots are also used in the online auction site for the bidding process. Due to this, unfortunately, human bidders are unable to compete with the software controlled robots. 
In order to prevent the unfair auction activity, it is necessary to prevent the robots from bidding in the auction.

Our goal will be to identify the online auction bids placed by "robots", so that the site owners could easily remove their auctions from the website and make the bidding process fair.

We will use classification techniques like Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Linear Regression.

3) Guide

People visit different places often in the vacation. To make more efficient and enjoyable vacation or more meaningful, this idea can be implemented.

As per already visited places and spent time, data will be analyzed on the basis of many features and that will be generated places or particular locations that user may visit or willing to visit. On the other hand, quality places may also be advised to a user that they are not visiting these places which have these particular subject of interest.
