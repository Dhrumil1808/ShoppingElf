# Project-Team-6

Project Idea: 

1. Pricify

Finding your dream house is painstaking job nowadays and what makes it harder is knowing correct price for it! 
Or 
If you are selling your house getting right is again a worrisome job.

We have decided to build an interactive chatbot application will ask a home buyer to describe their dream house and will extract features from text to predict house price. 

We will use advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting 
On approximately 79 feature set to design self-learning algorithm for price prediction.
Interactive chat feature will be accomplished by using Conversation API at bluemix.net

2. Human or Robot?

In today's digital world, softwares are used everywhere to expedite the completion of the task.  Thus, the robots are also used in the online auction site for the bidding process. Due to this, unfortunately, human bidders are unable to compete with the software controlled robots. 
In order to prevent the unfair auction activity, it is necessary to prevent the robots from bidding in the auction.

Our goal will be to identify the online auction bids placed by "robots", so that the site owners could easily remove their auctions from the website and make the bidding process fair.

We will use classification techniques like Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Linear Regression.
