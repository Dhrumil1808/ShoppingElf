# Project-Team-6

Project Idea: 

Pricify

Finding your dream house is painstaking job nowadays and what makes it more difficult is knowing correct price for it! 
Or 
If you are selling your house getting right is again a worrisome job.

We have decided to build an interactive chatbot application will ask a home buyer to describe their dream house and will extract features from text to predict house price. 

We will use advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting 
On approximately 79 feature set to design self-learning algorithm for price prediction.
Interactive chat feature will be accomplished by using Conversation API at bluemix.net
